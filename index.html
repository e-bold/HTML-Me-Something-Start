         <h1 id="mainHeading">Roadtrip to the West </h1> 
         <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">In 2019, my wife and I embarked on a road trip across the West Coast of the US. We mapped out our trip, making sure to include five National and State Parks that we had always wanted to visit. The trip took 21 days and covered 10 states. We began our roadtrip from St. Louis and first stopped in Estes Park, Colorado to explore Rocky Mountain National Park. We then drove further west to the border of Nevada and California, to camp around Lake Tahoe. Further west into California, we spent time in Yosemite National Park and then visited nearby San Francisco. We then traveled south to Los Angeles before moving on to Palm Springs where we also saw Joshua Tree National Park. We finally began our journey back east to see landmarks in Page, Arizona.

               <h3>Rocky Mountain National Park</h3>
               <p>Our first stop was Estes Park, Colorado. We camped in the beautiful Rocky Mountain National Park for 4 days, but also spent time in the mountain town of Estes Park. We saw many wild animals, such as elk, throughout the park and even at our campsite. Although we were there in June, the weather was very cold due to the altitude. There was still quite a bit of snow at the higher altitudes, which blocked access to the Alpine Visitor Center in the park. We hiked a section of the park known as the Bear Lake corridor and saw many lakes and waterfalls along the trails. In addition to the park, we also explored the town of Estes Park. There were many small shops and restaurants to visit in town as well as a tram up the mountain. We also made sure to visit the Stanley Hotel, which the book The Shining is based on.</p>

               <h3>Lake Tahoe</h3>
               <p>Our second stop was South Lake Tahoe along the border of Nevada and California. We camped in D.L. Bliss State Park on the California side. We hiked many trails throughout the park and visited a landmark within the park known as Vikingsholm. Since the water in Lake Tahoe is very cold due to snow melt, we visited the beach, but did not venture to do any paddle boarding.

               <h3>Yosemite National Park</h3>
               <p>Our next stop was Yosemite National Park in California. We camped just outside the park with friends who drove from San Francisco to meet us there. Campsites in the park are limited since it is a popular rock climbing destination and the reservation system is first come, first serve. Yosemite was by far my favorite national park. Specifically, I was taken aback by the beauty of El Capitan. The park had vistas with out-of-this-world views and had so many hiking trails for adventure seekers. We hiked the Mist Trail that passes alongside a waterfall. However, just driving through the loop of the park is a sight to see. This was also the most crowded park that we visited.</p>

               <h3>San Francisco</h3>
               <p>We then drove in to San Francisco with our friends since the city is only a couple of hours away from Yosemite National Park. We stayed in Oakland and spent 3 days in the Bay Area seeing all of the landmarks and neighborhoods that San Francisco is known for. We visited the Golden Gate Bridge, Fisherman's Wharf, Coit Tower, Lombard Street, the Bay Bridge, Golden Gate Park, and the Botanical garden. We took an evening ride on a cable car, saw walruses at the wharf, biked around Golden Gate Park, and watched the Bay Bridge light up from the pier. We spent much of our days visiting all of the different neighborhoods in the city, dining at popular restaurants and taking in the monuments and churches. We visited the Mission District, Haight-Ashbury, and Castro neighborhoods. We were also able to catch up with many of our friends in the area.</p>

               <h3>Los Angeles</h3>
               <p>After San Francisco, we explored another city to the South, Los Angeles. We stayed in Korea town, but visited many neighborhoods around LA. We saw landmarks such as Angel's Flight, the Griffith Observatory, the Broad art museum, China Town, Santa Monica Pier, Getty Villa, and Venice Beach. We traveled around LA and Malibu, seeing the coastline while driving along the Pacific Cost Highway. We ate at a lot of great food spots in many neighborhoods throughout LA.</p>

               <h3>Joshua Tree</h3>
               <p>After visiting two major cities in California, San Francisco and Los Angeles, we traveled southeast into the desert and stopped by Joshua Tree National Park on our way to Palm Springs. The weather was very hot and was nearing 100Â°F. My advice for future visitors is to bring a very large water jug or container and make sure to fill it up at the entrance of the park because the water is shut off throughout the park on days with extreme temperatures. Joshua Tree was unlike any desert I had seen before as it is a location where both the Colorado and Mojave deserts converge. The were many unique plants in addition to the namesake Joshua Tree. We hiked trails and climbed along the large rock formations in the park. There is the notable Skull Rock along one of the trails that resembles a skull.

               <h3>Palm Springs</h3>
               <p>After stopping in Joshua Tree, we traveled along to our stay in Palm Springs, California. Palm Springs was a very nice, quiet town. We spent time driving through the neighborhoods to see the characteristic doors and famous houses such as Frank Sinatra's home and Elvis and Priscilla Presley's honeymoon home. We also visited the Cabazon dinosaurs. You can walk inside one of the dinosaurs and there is a gift shop. Palm Springs has date farms in the area and are known for their famous date shakes.</p>

               <h3>Page, Arizona</h3>
               <p>We began our journey back east toward St. Louis and our final stop was camping in Kanab, Utah and visiting Page, Arizona for two days. The campsite that we stayed at backed up to the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. Visiting Antelope Canyon was on my bucket list ever since I got my first Windows XP computer. I was always amazed by the stock wallpapers on my computer and there was one that showed the Antelope Canyons. We were not able to visit Antelope Canyon or The Wave, but there a many slot canyons in the area that we were able to explore. Because of the increase in popularity of The Wave site, you now have to register for a permit very far in advance. We also saw the famous Horseshoe Bend location of the Colorado River. There were many people visiting Horseshoe Bend, but there were still many amazing views.
